In order to create a wallet, we first need to create a Portal **client**. Although in your production environment you will be doing this programmatically via the [new Client](../../reference/custodian-api/v1-endpoints.md#create-a-new-client) REST API endpoint, for testing purposes you can head to the Portal Admin Dashboard to create a test client.

A Portal **client** represents a single user. You use the Portal client as a 1:1 with users on your backend.

### Steps

1. Log in to the [Portal Admin Dashboard](https://app.portalhq.io). If don’t have access reach out to us to [request trial access](https://www.portalhq.io/book-demo)!
2. After you login, under “Settings” on the left hand side of the page, click on “API Keys”.

3. Once you have located the API keys section, click on “New Test Client API Key”. This will generate a test **client** with a **Client API Key -** test credentials for development purposes.

4. After clicking the “New Test Client API Key” button, this will pop open a window displaying the Client API Key and the Client ID. Go ahead and copy the Client API Key

Congrats! 🎉 You have now created your first Portal client and are ready to generate a wallet!
