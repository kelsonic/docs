### **Test for Accuracy**

* Verify that dApps show the updated metadata correctly.
* If you notice any discrepancies, return to the [Portal Admin Dashboard](https://app.portalhq.io) to make necessary adjustments.

<Warning>
If you don't provide custom metadata for WalletConnect, the default details will be from the Portal's organization information.
